# AIDataBaseMonitorPrediction
Amid the wave of digital transformation, databases—serving as the core carriers of enterprise data assets—directly impact business continuity through their stability and performance. Traditional database monitoring systems primarily rely on threshold-based alerts and visual charts, which suffer from issues such as delayed alerts, high false positive rates, and heavy reliance on operational experience. With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, how to apply cutting-edge AI methods like DTW (Dynamic Time Warping), FAISS (vector search), and LLM (large language models) to the field of database monitoring has become a critical challenge. The goal is to shift from "reactive response" to "proactive prediction" and from "visualized monitoring" to "intelligent operations," thereby redefining database management.

The system innovatively integrates three AI technologies: DTW for time series pattern matching, FAISS for high-dimensional vector similarity search, and LLM for intelligent analysis and decision support. Through a multi-algorithm fusion prediction engine, the system can predict database failures 30-60 minutes in advance. **The prediction accuracy based on the fusion algorithm is significantly improved**, substantially reducing database operational costs and enhancing system availability.
